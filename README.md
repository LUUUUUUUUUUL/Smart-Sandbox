# Smart-Sandbox
Smart way of organizing your sandbox/root folder with dynamic search capabilities so no matter how big or how small your sandbox/root folder is you can easily find your projects on any device.

## About
This came to mind when I realized how often I would just forget the name or simply had to many folders on my sandbox environment, this is a local site where i just mess around or creating prototypes and ideas.

So I created an easy way to display all folders in my sandbox environment with search capabilities.

### New Features on 2.0
- Light and dark theme
- Faster and better search
- Alphabetical and date sorting order
- New icons and better responsiveness
- Bug fixes

### Tip
Set up a domain on you local machine as dev.sandbox.com and place this index.php at the root level of that domain alternatively you could just place this at the root level of your htdocs if you use software like mamp/xamp/wamp, etc.

### Requirements

- PHP (with read access to the folders)
- JavaScript
- modern browser (chrome, firefox, safari or edge)
- IE9+

That's it really, all the magic is done with php and javascript.
