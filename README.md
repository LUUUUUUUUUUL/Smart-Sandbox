# Smart-Sandbox
Smart way of organizing your sandbox/root folder with dynamic search capabilities so no matter how big or how small your sandbox/root folder is you can easily find your projects.

## About
This came to mind when i realized how ofted i would forget the name of the old folders on my sandbox, has this is a folder where i just mess arround or create prototypes, so I wanted a easy way to display all folders in my sandbox enviroment by alphabetical olrder and a dynamic search.

### Tip
Set up a domain on you local machine as dev.sandbox.com and place this index.php at the root level of that domain or just place this at the root level of your htdocs if you use something like mamp.

### Requirements

- PHP (with read access to the folders)
- JavaScript

That's it really, all the trickery is done with php and js, a modernish browser will also be needed, if you use IE make sure you running 9+ as i have not tested this bellow that.
