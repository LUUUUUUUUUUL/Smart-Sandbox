## About
This came to mind when I realized how often I would just forget the name or simply had to many folders on my sandbox environment, this is a local site where i just mess around or creating prototypes and ideas.

So I created an easy way to display all folders in my sandbox environment with search capabilities. Best of all is really small at only 14kb!

### Tip
Set up a domain on you local machine as dev.sandbox.com and place this index.php at the root level of that domain alternatively you could just place this at the root level of your htdocs if you use software like mamp/xamp/wamp, etc.

### Requirements

- PHP (with read access to the folders)

That's it really, all the magic is done with php and javascript.
